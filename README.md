# Home-Credit-Default-Risk-Prediction
This is my Repo for Home Credit Default Risk Prediction.

Home Credit, a consumer finance company, faces the challenge of extending loans to
individuals with little or no credit history. Many applicants lack traditional banking records,
making it di?icult to assess their ability to repay. Poor credit risk assessment can result in
financial losses from defaults or missed opportunities when creditworthy customers are
wrongly denied.
